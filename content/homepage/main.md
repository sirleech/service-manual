# Learning Design Standards

The Australian Public Service Commission and the Digital Transformation Agency have been working with various community groups on the first drafts of the Building Digital Capability Learning Design Standards.

These learning design standards are blueprints for learning and development and will guide APS training for digital skills. They set out things, that based on user research, public servants need to know, do and be in a digital world. This includes areas like agile delivery, content design, cyber security and cloud.

They will :

- Give APS employees the opportunity to learn new digital skills so that they are qualified to move into new and diverse roles
Help managers understand, recognise and build digital skills within teams so the service they provide meets the Digital Service Standard, without outsourcing to contractors

- Provide the framework for learning and training future and existing APS employees

- Help leaders ensure their agencies are using proven digital approaches so they may deliver better digital services to citizens

## What are learning design standards?

Learning design standards set the bar for what makes a good digital specialist. They describe the skills and knowledge you need and suggest ways in which you can learn them. We and the Australian Public Service Commission have heard from APS employees that immediate needs are in Agile delivery management, user research, content design and in the fundamentals of digital. So these are the first 4 learning design standards we are publishing for use on the digital marketplace.

## How do I use a learning design standard?

You can use the learning design standard to help you identify the training you and your team might need to help you develop your digital skills. We have made this easy by integrating the learning design standards with the training stream on the digital marketplace. You can identify the learning needs you have and providers can respond with their designs to your request.
